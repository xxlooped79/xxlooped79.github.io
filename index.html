<p>Hello, world!</p>

  <h1>The Moment I Realized My Professor Is a Person Too</h1>

  <p>
    Coming into college, I thought professors were basically academic robots. They showed up,
    lectured for an hour, assigned homework, and disappeared into their offices until the next
    class. I never really questioned that idea until one small moment completely changed how
    I see my professors.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>A Small Comment That Changed Everything</h2>

  <p>
    One day after class, my professor casually mentioned how they still get nervous before
    presenting at conferences. That surprised me. This was someone who confidently lectures
    in front of over a hundred students, yet they admitted to feeling the same anxiety many
    of us feel before presentations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In that moment, I realized professors are not just authority figures. They are people who
    once sat in the same desks we do now, worrying about grades, deadlines, and whether they
    were good enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>It made the classroom feel less intimidating and more human.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Why That Matters as a Student</h2>

  <p>
    Seeing professors as real people made me more comfortable asking questions and
    participating in class. Instead of worrying about sounding stupid, I remembered that
    learning is a process, even for experts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>College is not just about memorizing information.</strong> It is about connecting
    with ideas and the people who teach them. When professors show their humanity, it reminds
    students that growth does not stop after graduation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This experience changed how I approach class in a few important ways:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I feel more comfortable asking questions</li>
    <li>I participate more during lectures</li>
    <li>I see learning as an ongoing process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Now, when I walk into class, I do not just see someone grading my assignments. I see a
    person who chose to teach, to learn, and to keep improving, just like us.
