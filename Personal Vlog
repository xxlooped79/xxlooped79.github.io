    <h2>Why I Find Learning Web Design Interesting</h2>

    <p>
        Web design is interesting to me because it blends creativity with logic.
        You get to design how something looks <em>and</em> control how it works.
        <br>
        Every small change in HTML or CSS can completely change how a page feels.
    </p>

    <p>
        One thing I enjoy most is seeing my work come to life in the browser.
        It feels rewarding to write code and immediately see the result.
        <strong>That instant feedback makes learning more fun.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Some things I enjoy about web development include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Designing layouts</li>
        <li>Learning new HTML tags</li>
        <li>Improving my problem-solving skills</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If I want help or inspiration, I often visit
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
        because it explains HTML clearly.
